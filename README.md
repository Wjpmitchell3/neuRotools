# neuRotools
neurRotools contains a collection of functions to facilitate the analysis of neuroimaging data using video stimuli. It is still very much in the early stages of development, but includes a number of helpful functions to generate onset files, sort observations, clean data files, etc. It is being developed to be a complement to my [NaStiPy repository](https://github.com/wj-mitchell/NaStiPy). ***NaStiPy*** is also still in development and will consist of a number of convenient custom functions to generate tasks that utilize naturalistic video stimuli.   

More developments to come soon!
